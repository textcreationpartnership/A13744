            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The conſequent muſt be denied.

For although the ſonne was with the father, yet the ſcripture ſpeaketh of him that he is God and man, which was ſent into the world for this purpoſe, that he ſhould be the propitiatour, or obteiner of mercie, and the quickener of mankind.

               <p>There be ſixe cauſes of the churches afflictions. The firſt cauſe is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> common, and pertinent to all men, that is to wit, ſinne, or the corruption of nature, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fall of our firſt parents, and ſpred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad by generation into all their poſteritie. And of this cauſe it was ſaid:<note place="margin">Gene. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>In quacunque die comederis, morte morieris:</hi> Whenſoeuer thou dooſt eate of the trée, thou ſhalt die the death. And againe:<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Per vnum hominem peccatum in mundum intrauit, &amp; per peccatum mors:</hi> By one man ſinne came into the world, and by ſinne came death. The philoſophers make will and matter the cauſe of ſickeneſſe and of death, as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of an apple is the cauſe of his putrifac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But theſe are not the principall cauſes. The principall and chéefe cauſe of ſickeneſſe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:27990:52"/> and death, is ſinne, for the which mans nature is ſubiect to corruption and death.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And the ſecond cauſe truelie, whie the church or congregation of God is more ſubiect to the croſſe and miſerie than other men are, is the diuell, which bicauſe he hateth God, he inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his church the more gréeuouſlie than anie other companie.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third cauſe is, bicauſe God would haue his wrath againſt ſinne to be perceiued and knowne; which the wicked companie and the epicurean ſort doo ſecurelie contemne and ſcoffe at.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The fourth cauſe is, for that the church hath alſo hir ſinnes, which muſt be mortified by the croſſe of afflictions.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The ſixt cauſe is, that we ſhould be certeine that there remaineth another iudgement, in the which the godlie that haue béene afflicted in this life, as <hi>Iohn</hi> the baptiſt and <hi>Paule</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhall be rewarded; and the wicked, as <hi>Herod, Nero,</hi> and ſuch other ſhall be puniſhed with eternall death: bicauſe it is impoſſible, that the godlie people ſhould be alwaies in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie,

               <p>I anſwer to the antecedent by diſtinction. The things which we deſire of God, are of two ſorts.

This carefulneſſe doubleth our

All mankind that haue liued from the creation of the world to that time, ſhall riſe againe whole and perfect, with their bodies &amp; ſoules before the iudgement ſeat of God, and ſhall go to reaping of the fruits that they haue ſowne in this world: namelie, they that haue ſowne in the fleſh,<note place="margin">Galar. 6.</note> ſhall reape corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the fleſh; and thoſe that haue ſowne in the ſpirit, ſhall reape life euerlaſting.</p>

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:27990:81"/> ſpeaketh not héere of the generall iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ſhall be at the end of the world, when Chriſt ſhall appeare in the maieſtie of his glorie, to iudge the quicke and the dead; for then all without exception, both good and euill, ſhall riſe againe to receiue the reward of the works of their bodies. Of this reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection <hi>S. Paule</hi> ſpeaketh abundantlie,<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 4. 1.

Againe, the wicked ſhall not ariſe in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when they ſhall be giuen to be iudged by the word of God, &amp; yet will not amend their liues, but will flie from the face of the earth with a troubled conſcience; they will
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:27990:82"/> not be reprooued, but hate correction, &amp; when Gods word condemneth them, they will growe into the furie of madneſſe, they will not heare wholſome doctrine, but blaſpheme it and perſecute it euen to the death, like ſwine and mad dogs. As for example. The Phariſeis ſtirred againſt the Lord and his Chriſt, they came together, they conſulted, they practiſed althings to kéepe the pompe of their owne glorie &amp; lucre: and to deſtroie Chriſt and his goſpell. This is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the pſalmograph. The wicked doo not ariſe and aſcend into iudgement, to iudge themſelues to amendment of life, but lie in blindneſſe, and harden themſelues in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, not ſuffering the iudgement of the ſpirit: whereas euerie good man will glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie haue all his owne righteouſnes (which is like a defiled cloth) to be condemned,<note place="margin">Eſaie. 64.</note> and to appeale to the righteouſneſſe which we haue in Chriſt Ieſus, to whom with the father and the Holie-ghoſt be all power, honor and glorie, now and for euer and euer, Amen.</p>
